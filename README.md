# Raytracer

Completed rust version of the first six chapters of "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by Jamis Buck.

Got to the point of implementing enough to render my first 3d image of a sphere with a simple single color material. Ultimately I would like to finish the rest of the chapters in the book, and stripe the output canvas so that I can parallelise the rendering loop to speed things up.
